Addis Software Test Project - MERN Stack
As a full stack developer you should be able to write both client side and server side codes.
This test project will determine your ability to do that by using the MERN (MongoDB,
ExpressJS, ReactJS & NodeJS) stack. Develop your frontend as well as your backend
applications based on their corresponding instructions and integrate them with each other
to make it a Full Stack Application.
Backend
Develop a Rest API that will let you manage information for songs. Your API will be able to
create, list, update and remove songs. You will only need to create one model to handle the
song data. The expected information are
Title
Artist
Album
Genre
You are also expected to generate overall statistics:
Total # of songs, artists, albums, genres
# of songs in every genre
# of songs & albums each artist has
# songs in each album ... and so on.
You can add any stat you can think of.
Technologies
Use the technologies below to create your backend Rest API.
●ExpressJS : To handle your requests.
●
●
●MongoDB : To store your data.
Mongoose : To interact with MongoDB, model your data and to create your schema.
Docker: package your backend using docker

Frontend
The frontend part of your app should primarily show a list of songs and enable clients to
create, update, and delete songs. In addition, it should have a section where the statistics
data is shown. It should utilize the backend Rest API you built to fulfill the functionalities.
Technologies
Use the technologies below to create your frontend web application.
Typescript : use typescript to write your codes. Try not to use the type Any as
●much as possible.
ReactJS: To build your user interface.
●Redux Toolkit: To manage the state of your app. You should first read about redux
●
●to learn the core concepts.
Redux - Saga: To make calls to your Rest API.
Emotion and Styled system: To style your app.
●Whenever a song is added, updated, or deleted, the latest changes should be shown
without reloading the page.

Bonus
Add a filtering functionality such as filter by genre. Hosting your application on free
platforms like netlify or vercel for frontend and render for backend is a plus.
